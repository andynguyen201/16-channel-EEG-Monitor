# 16-channel-EEG-Monitor


The advent of home-based health monitoring systems has opened new vistas for patient care,
offering unprecedented convenience and empowerment to users managing neurological conditions.
This document presents a detailed proposal for an innovative 16-channel EEG monitoring device,
specifically engineered for home use without compromising on the clinical quality of EEG data. By
leveraging cutting-edge technology to ensure secure and efficient transmission of raw EEG data to
cloud platforms, our device is designed to meet the stringent demands of modern healthcare.
Furthermore, it addresses crucial aspects such as cost-effectiveness, user experience, and reliability.
Through a holistic approach to design and functionality, I aim to deliver a solution that not only fulfills
clinical needs but also enhances the overall user journey, ensuring that advanced neurological
monitoring is both accessible and practical for everyday use.
